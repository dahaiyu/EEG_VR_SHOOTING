Author: Jiali Xie, Yichen Li, Ruijia Cheng


Objectives:
=======================================================

1. Build a EEG controlled VR shooting game using Oculus VR & Unity3D.
2. Utilize neuro-feedback strategy to train two groups of players with increasing
attention level or increasing attention time respectively.
3. Perform a test to evaluate the performance between training groups and the control group to see if the attention is improved for those who receive training.
